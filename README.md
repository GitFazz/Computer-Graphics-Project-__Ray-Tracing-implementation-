# Goal 

I  will generate realistic images for a few geometric shapes using ray tracing with appropriate illumination technique. 


# theory and tools

1. OpenGL 
2. Fully controllable camera 
3. Bitmap image generation using the bitmap image header file (added)
4. Basic idea of illumination, Phong lighting model
5. Intersection of line with different 3D objects (e.g. ray-plane intersection, ray-sphere
intersection, ray-triangle intersection etc.) 
6. Multi-level reflection using ray tracing 
7. Refraction using ray tracing, 
8. texture 

... etc.
